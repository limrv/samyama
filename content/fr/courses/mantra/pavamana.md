These three statements are referred to as the three Pavamana Mantras.
Some modern renderings add ॐ (oṃ) at the beginning and ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः ॥
(oṃ śāntiḥ śāntiḥ śāntiḥ, 'om peace peace peace') as a fourth line,
but these are not present in the original Upanishadic text.


* asataḥ — "from falsehood"; ablative case of asat "falsehood",
from a (negation) + sat "truth"; becomes asato due to sandhi
* mā — "me"; first person pronoun, singular number, accusative case
* sat — "to truth"; accusative case of sat "truth";
here accusative case shows the destination;
see also Sat (Sanskrit); becomes sad due to sandhi
* gamaya — "lead"; causative, imperative mood, active voice, singular number,
second person of root gam "to go".
* tamasaḥ — "from darkness"; ablative case of tamas "darkness";
becomes tamaso due to sandhi
* jyotiḥ — "to light"; accusative case of jyotis "light";
becomes jyotir due to sandhi
* mṛtyoḥ — "from death"; ablative case of mṛtyu "death";
see also Mrtyu; becomes mṛtyor due to sandhi
* amṛtaṃ — "to immortality"; accusative case of amṛta "immortal",
literally "not dead", from a (negation) + mṛta "dead";
becomes 'mṛtaṃ due to vowel elision.
